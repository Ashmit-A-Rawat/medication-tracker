# medication-tracker (NEWBIETHON PROJECT)#
"Medication Tracker," uses React for the frontend to build a responsive and dynamic user interface. 
The backend is powered by Node.js, which handles the server-side logic, while MongoDB is utilized for storing user data, including medication information and schedules. 
The application allows users to log their medications, set reminders, and track dosage schedules, making it easier for them to manage their medications. 
User authentication is also implemented to ensure personalized access and security. This full-stack solution provides a seamless and efficient way to keep track of medications.
